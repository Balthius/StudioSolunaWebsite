        My name is Josh Folsom; I've built this site in order to demonstrate my technical skills from a portfolio perspective, and as a gathering point for all of my various projects and relevant accounts for personal use as well.
        <br><br>
        Studio Soluna represents a dream of my wife and mine, to create a platform that we can launch a variety of projects across many mediums.

    <h5> I'll be updating each page with items in 3 phases.</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Incomplete: Projects that are viewable (in some form) but not usable.</li>
        <li> Complete: Usable, but just there to showcase a skill.</li>
        <li> Active: Both complete (at least a minimum viable product) and will continue to be updated.</li>
    </ul>
