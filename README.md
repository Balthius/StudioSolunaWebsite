# StudioSolunaLandingPage

### My personal website, Using a combination of Razor pages, SCSS, CSS Grids and some default bootstrap. 

###### You may notice that my website is set up to redirect from it's default domain over to https://studiosolunalandingpage.azurewebsites.net. I've been learning how to use Cloud based solutions, so one of my practice challenges was hosting my website through Azure and working out how to properly point my traffic over to it.


###### In the root of my project is a TemplateGeneration folder, which you can generate a basic folder layout from for your SASS/SCSS
